            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/Background.jpg" alt="Background Image">
            <p>Roy is a dedicated advocate for universal healthcare and community well-being, armed with a Bachelor's in Clinical Medicine and Community Health. As the founder of Transcendence Kenya and co-founder of Bit & Crunch, I am deeply committed to driving positive change through innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a writer and researcher. I weave narratives that go beyond statistics, aiming to connect hearts to the cause of accessible healthcare. My passion for healthcare extends beyond the pages; I am an active member of Rotary International, currently serving as the charter president of the Rotaract Club of Murang'a. Additionally, as an engaged Red Cross Kenya volunteer, I contribute to emergency response efforts and community resilience.</p>
            <p>Driven by the belief that transformative change starts at the community level, I've spent years actively promoting health for all awareness and leveraging my skills to make a tangible impact. Alongside my advocacy and organizational roles, I actively engage in writing and research to amplify the voices of those impacted by healthcare disparities.</p>
            <p>My mission is clear: to see lives transformed through accessible healthcare and education. I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals, organizations, and collaborators who share a vision for a healthier, more empowered world. Let's collaborate to make a lasting impact together.</p>
